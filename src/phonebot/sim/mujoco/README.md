# Mujoco Environment

NOTE: as of Feb. 14th, 2020, I no longer have access to the Mujoco license.

As such, the development of the mujoco backend will be on hiatus.

You are welcome to experiment with the environment, but the current implementation as-is will nto be functional.

Mostly left here for archival purposes.
